## ðŸ“– Project Synopsis

### ðŸ›‘ Problem Statement
Ethiopia is rapidly digitizing its public and financial services using the **Fayeda Digital ID**.  
However, this growth has led to:
- Identity theft & unauthorized digital ID use  
- Phishing attacks targeting citizens and institutions  
- No centralized AI-driven platform to detect and prevent such threats  

Citizens lack visibility into when their IDs are misused, and authorities lack **real-time intelligence** to protect them.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Planned Solution
**FayedaGuard** is an **AI-powered cybersecurity platform** integrated with Fayeda Digital ID to:
1. **Detect & alert** citizens of unauthorized ID usage in real time  
2. **Predict & prevent fraud** using AI anomaly detection  
3. **Protect biometric identity verification** by detecting deepfakes and spoofing attempts  
4. **Provide a national cybersecurity dashboard** for INSA to monitor emerging threats

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Expected Outcome
- **Reduce identity theft and fraud** involving Fayeda IDs  
- **Increase citizen trust** in Ethiopiaâ€™s digital identity ecosystem  
- **Provide actionable cyber threat intelligence** to national authorities  
- **Position Ethiopia** as a leader in secure digital identity management in Africa

---

### ðŸ”— Fayedaâ€™s Role
Fayeda serves as the **backbone for secure digital identity**:  
- Citizens authenticate with their **Fayeda Digital ID** to access FayedaGuard.  
- Alerts, activity logs, and fraud detection are **linked to verified IDs**, ensuring reliability and security.
